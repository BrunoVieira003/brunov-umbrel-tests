  Airstation is a self-hosted web app for streaming music over the Internet. It features a simple interface for uploading tracks and managing the playback queue, along with a minimalistic player for listeners.
  
  Under the hood, it streams music over HTTP using HLS, stores data in SQLite, and leverages FFmpeg for audio processing â€” all packaged in a compact Docker container for easy deployment
